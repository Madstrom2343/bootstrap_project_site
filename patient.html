            <!-- Story -->
            <p class="display-6 mb-5">In an older Victorian house hastily turned hospital, from the recent epidemic of the Siege virus, a younger man was working in a room of bedded patients in a smaller room upstairs. There were four rooms in total, three were old bedrooms turned into resting locations & a hallway to connect them all together. This room was the second biggest bedroom of the lot. “That’s the rest from the upstairs wing.” spoke quietly the man. The woman those words were meant for, nodded her head. The woman was a much older & kinder soul, big body & thin almost stick-like limbs. “Sounds great, hun. Do you work tomorrow by chance?” The young man shook his head & started with a gentle grin. “The wife wants me home for the weekend, she’s still not comfortable being alone & expecting.” This reply stirred a happiness in the man only love could make, despite the sick patients around him as well as the situation of the world in his day. The older woman smiled, remembering somberly the better days herself, but then she jumped up, “Oh, you got the sanitizing room as well right?”</p>
            <p class="display-6 mb-5">The sanitizing room. This was the room where those dangerously affected came in. It wasn’t clear how but their conditions pre-infection were unfortunate enough, now with it they were wildcards for what could happen. The man forgot everything in his once cleared head. His hairs began to stand on his arms. “That room”, he thought, “that damned room. I hate it, absolutely hate it.” His uneasiness showed like that of a child realising what a big mistake they’d made.</p>
            <p class="display-6 mb-5">“Look, I know you hate it, but you have to care for them all.” The woman stated. “I know, it's just I’ve never been a fan of those patients.” “I know, but I refuse to go in there as well.” Replied the woman. Just as they finished, almost as a line queued up during a play, a faint yet obnoxious giggle was heard. It was coming from the hallway, in the smallest room of resting patients. The giggle came from a man meant for the sanitizing room, wandering along the upstairs & invading personal spaces of any he saw looking back at him. The young man couldn't decide which made this disturbed man more fearful, the fact he was able to leave the sanitizing room at all, or the fact his first decision was to head towards the room of children & young adults.</p>
            <p class="display-6 mb-5">Hesitantly, the efforts of the young man was to send the disturbed man back into his respective room, however they had no idea how he'd react. "Sir, it's time to return to the-" he choked on his words, eyes widening ever so slightly. What returned his words was a decrepid & thin man, who was registered in his twenties but looked well into his sixties. His outfit was like that of a straight jacket, thick & heavy, with straps for restriction if necessary. But his sleeves were loose, brushing on the floor like that of a cape. His balding head held what looked like cracks along an old wall, with small traces of puss along the edges. His eyes were glassy, like that of a lantern in an abandoned mine. As he opened his mouth to speak, a smile opened his head more, revealing green blotched gums & teeth with great spaces between them & all of them loose enough to swing with each breath he took. It felt like hours to the young man before the patient finally spoke after looking at him. "Aye jerst wentad tyuu maeet tha nuu fraendsss hmmm mmm." The almost creature-like patient spoke like that of a gibbering toddler, unable to speak maturely or sanely. He was a mental handicap prior to his infection, now with complete loss of neurological control, the actions he did varied every minute.
                The young man was very much startled, but he knew he was depended on for the safety of all in this upstairs part of the hospital. Patiently he guided the crazed man back to the sanitizing room, hoping to lock the ghoul & all the other disturbed in the sanitizing room & head home to his wife.</p>
            <p class="display-6 mb-5">"Aye duun whaant tew goo baeck een theyur." The disturbed man spoke. His wide & ungodly smile reversed, becoming a frown that only grew more unsettling as he began to creak & moan, breathing heavier & heavier, being urged into the room. Just trying to get him inside, the man grew tense over & over wishing the patient would listen. "Damn you" he thought again "damn you to hell, you creature." All he could think about was getting the man inside & return to his waiting beloved, away from here. The young man spoke calmly, "If I go in with you, I will prove to you there's no reason not to be in there. It's nice in there." "Ayll off dah peepul een heyur arrr sweepang. Sweepang theyurr Peritee dweeams hmmm mmm." The young man had to suppress his fight or flight, but the patient's previous grin had been returning ever so slowly, & this couldn't have kept even the most patient of men relaxed. In a whisper the young man retorted "then we'll just have to be quiet when we get you to your bed, yeah?" A giggle returned in the hallway & the patient began to clap loudly, then, like a child in surprise, he stopped abruptly & pursed his lips against his finger. "Shhhh."
                The door to the sanitizing room was to be locked from the outside at all times, even while doctors & nurses went in to prevent the patients inside. The door had been left unlocked & creaked gently as the two walked & spoke by it. The young man, alerted, wished to grasp how the door was unlocked, but he had little time for thought as long as the mad patient was free. Inside the man went into the sanitizing room, watching diligently his surrounding as his wits were needed in such a place. The patient followed in almost in a comical tip toe, like that of a cartoon villain attempting to walk past prison lights. The first thing that greeted the young man was the smell. The repulsive, gag inducing stench of vomit, blood, & excrement mixed about. This room was the least cared for, being molded & worn out compared to the rest of the house. Once the light from the hallway spilled into the room as the door creaked more open, a dark truth was revealed.</p>
            <p class="display-6 mb-5">"Shee, Saweepang mmmm hmmm mmm." He couldn't help but let out an eerie moaning sound. The 'sleeping' were no comparison to those already robbed of life. Some showed marks of a struggle along their necks, while others were riddled with holes along their bellies. The young man knew he had to play along, 'less he join the others after life. He nodded with an empty smile, "yes, they're sleeping" he held back tears, as they both pressed a finger to their lips, "shhh." The young man's heart was beating so loudly he swore it shook the whole house. All of these insane & afflicted peoples had been slaughtered by a lunatic, the same lunatic this man found himself sharing a room with. "Now" he tried to hold himself together "wh- why don't we-" the patient cut in. "Shhhhh, theyurr saweepang nmm." The young man closed his eyes & repeated softer, "y- yes, right. Why do- why don't we go to sleep now, yes?" The disturbed man shook his head with a grin. </p>
            <p class="display-6 mb-5">The young man had to leave. He knew if he didn't leave now, he never will. He mustered as much courage as anyone could & restated, "It is bed time for us, we must dream happy dreams. Now go to bed my friend." The ghoul's moans returned. He grew excited, but then remembered to be quiet. "Ooakey, whee goow tu saweep nouw." He creeped to the furthest corner & sat on the floor in the muck of his doing, slowly rocking himself like a mother would her baby.</p>
            <p class="display-6 mb-5">A young woman had come to the hospital in a gentle panic hoping to find her husband. Despite his warnings not to go anywhere near where she could get infected, she loved him too much to stay calm & wait for him. She spoke to a lady at the desk of the first floor & asked for the location of her husband. "He's upstairs," the desk lady said, "he should've clocked off earlier but we had a slight emergency." The young woman thanked her & sat in the dining room, now turned waiting room, for her husband to be finished.</p>
            <p class="display-6 mb-5">As the young man kept his eyes on the last position of the crazed patient, he walked backwards, not stopping until he was out. Out of the room, out for good. He crept backwards, never losing sight of the corner until he felt the door. Once he did he closed it gently, locked it, & rushed downstairs.</p>
            <p class="display-6 mb-5">As the young woman waited for the father of her child to be, she heard the rushing of feet along the stairs. They belonged to the man she was hoping to see. As their eyes met, his look of fear became puzzled, & as he got past the last step he opened his arms for her to embrace him. "Love, you're supposed to be home." "& so are you" she retorted, "now what kept you waiting so long?" "Work, as always. I wish I could've been home but I'll make up for it tomorrow, promise." "Damn right you will." She said with a smile. The young man said he'd wash up & grab his things then they'd be off. As he left & she sat back down, she thought to herself. Thought about how happy she'd be getting out of here, how happy she'd be spending time with him tomorrow, starting their family & living their best life during, as well as after, this virus. That was until she was interrupted by gentle footsteps coming down the stairs.</p>
            <p class="display-6 mb-5">As the young man was heading back to the waiting room to leave, his eyes widened. He watched as his mortified wife was being inspected & played with by a familiar sight. It was the Decrepit patient. The one who was supposed to be locked up in the sanitizing room upstairs. He had no idea how this was possible. "Wheyall arrnt yhuu paweetee hmmm mmmm." The appalling man said as he looked the young woman over with his glassy almost dead looking eyes & played with her hair. The man began to grow fearful, concerned for the safety of his wife. The moaning of the ghoul began again, & he looked at the woman's stomach "ohh, yhuu haavee ayy wittle waan een theyurr." The hand previously stroking her hair found it's way to her stomach, his hand over it like that of a caring father. The patient spoke again, "yhuu noo aii kood geev yhuu ayy beattar waan hmmmmmm. Aii kood taek thaat waan aout aandd maeek yhuur baeebee beetar mmm hmmm." Tears welled in her eyes as the disturbed man started rubbing his nails against her clothing.
                The man's fear shrank, no longer had he been afraid. This thing was endangering his Wife, his only joy in this collapsing world. He surrendered to his emotions & let the adrenaline finally kick in. As he did, the repulsive patient released his hand as if to claw at her belly. When he threw his force in his arm to seemingly rip the baby out of her, the young man had interrupted it's target. As a finger with a pointed nail dug through the young man's hand, he growled. Not humanly, like that of a wolf. The young man stood the patient up & began to strangle him. Harder & harder, pulling him up & away from his beloved, his eyes revealed a fury even the disturbed patient was scared of.</p>
            <p class="display-6 mb-5">As doctors & other workers came in, confused at the situation, the young man threw the Decrepit ghoul to the ground. He put all his pent up fear & anger from all the events this diseased individual put him through into that throw. He immediately grabbed his wife & left quickly, not letting the situation lengthen for him or her. When the staff went to comfort the now crying patient, he pleaded he was just trying to be friends, bawling like a spoiled child & drooling everywhere. The young man would hear none of it, & finally got ready to leave the building. As he turned to close the door on all the staff attempting to keep him, he noticed through the small crowd, sharp eyes, eyes he had remembered, those glassy dead eyes. & they were piercing right into his own, as a predator would mark it's prey. The young man felt a shiver down his spine as he slammed the door. After that night, the young man resigned from that hospital in order to fully care for his wife, as well as to guarantee he wouldn't be anywhere near that sinister patient. As for his hand, he & his wife agreed tending to it at home with researched methods would prove safer than going to any other medical facilities keeping the virus in mind.</p>
            <p class="display-6 mb-5">It was now a few weeks since the young man had left the hospital, & everything seemed forgotten by him & his wife as they relaxed on their furniture, making the best of the night, until a report came in that a local hospital had been slaughtered, staff, patients & all by a mysterious old looking man in a restriction jacket. As the man shut off the news to forget everything that happened..
                There was a creak from his recently locked door, & a giggle. A giggle he remembered all too well.</p>
